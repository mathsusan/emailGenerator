#Email Creator

I was looking for a way to create html email for a project where I could easily change the words without hunting through all that mess of html.

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repo and use it to generate your email.
``npm install
gulp serve
``

## Testing the email
The generated html will be in build/index.html
Use Litmus or some other email testing software to test the email.
